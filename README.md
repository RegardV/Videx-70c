## Local Installation with Docker (Windows)

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop for Windows installed and running
- Windows 10/11 with WSL2 enabled
- Docker engine running and accessible

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```powershell
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd videx
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```powershell
   docker build -t videx .
   ```

3. Run the container:
   ```powershell
   docker run -d `
     -p 5173:5173 `
     -p 3001:3001 `
     -v //./pipe/docker_engine://./pipe/docker_engine `
     --name videx `
     videx
   ```

   Note: The application will automatically find available ports if 5173 or 3001 are in use.

4. Access the interface:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Port Configuration

VIDEX/70 uses two ports by default:
- `5173`: Web interface
- `3001`: WebSocket server

If these ports are in use, the application will automatically find available ports in the range 3001-3999.

### Using the Terminal

1. Click the gear icon in the top-right corner
2. Choose between:
   - Demo Mode: Test the interface with a simulated terminal
   - System PowerShell: Launch a local PowerShell session
   - Container Mode: Connect to a real Docker container by entering its ID

### Multiple Sessions

- Open multiple terminals by connecting to different containers
- Rename sessions by clicking the edit icon on the terminal tab
- Switch between sessions using the tabs
- Close sessions using the √ó button on each tab

### Theme Switching

Toggle between IBM Orange and IBM Green themes using the theme button in the top-right corner.

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è Important security notes:

- Only run on trusted networks
- Don't expose to the internet without proper security measures
- Use authentication if deploying in a production environment
- Be cautious with container access permissions

## Development

If you want to run the project without Docker for development:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
